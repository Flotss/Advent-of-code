# ADVENT OF CODE

This is my attempt at the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles. I'm using this as an opportunity to learn [java](https://www.java.com/en/).

## Running the code

To run the code, you'll need to have [java](https://www.java.com/en/) installed. 

Then, you have to compile the code. To do this, run the following command in the root directory of the project:

    javac -d bin src/Day<day number>/*.java

Then, you can run the code with the following command:

    java -cp bin Day<number>.Part<number>
