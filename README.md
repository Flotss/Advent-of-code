# ADVENT OF CODE

This is my attempt at the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles. I'm using this as an opportunity to
learn [java](https://www.java.com/en/).

## How to use it

To run the code, you'll need to have [java](https://www.java.com/en/) installed.

Then, you have to compile the code. To do this, run the following command in the root directory of the project:

### Compiling the code

Windows :

    dir .\src\*.java /s /B > sources.txt
    javac -d bin @sources.txt

Linux :

    find ./src -name "*.java" > sources.txt
    javac -d bin @sources.txt

### Running the code

Then, you can run the code with the following command:

    java -cp bin Run

### Exemple

## IMPORTANT ! Inputs

You must change your inputs in  :

        src/inputs/

Else, the result will be the result of [Flotss](https://github.com/Flotss) and not yours.
